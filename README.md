The program consists of a C++ implementation of a menu-driven console application. It includes various features such as checking for balanced parentheses in an infix expression and converting an infix expression to a postfix expression using a stack data structure. Additionally, it includes a queue data structure with functionalities like enqueue, dequeue, checking if the queue is empty, retrieving the front element, and finding the size of the queue. The program provides a user-friendly menu interface for choosing between these different functionalities and allows users to interact with and test the stack and queue operations.
